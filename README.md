Hi friends, this is a project I started a few years ago for a new type of calendar that would be a companion app to my Vector Clock. I'm not so great at coding and the technical aspects were too much for me but my vision was for this SVG image to be scripted so that the current day would be highlighted somehow and various notes could be added for each day. Basically I just don't have time to learn how to do all that, but I did have time to create the SVG backbone of the project. With any luck someone will see the potential here and develop the idea further. Thanks for your time.
